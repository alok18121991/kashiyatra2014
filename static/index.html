			<p>Kashiyatra, the annual cultural festival of IIT (BHU) Varanasi is, as the name suggests, a journey encompassing tradition, culture and heritage with the modern outlook of the 21st century. Kashiyatra is four days of celebration of the grandeur of Kashi with the spirit of youth. It is four days of unhindered fun and entertainment, a time to let loose, absorb the vibrance and revel in the roots of our culture.</p>
			<p>Kashiyatra is also one of the largest cultural festivals of North India, a platform for hundreds of competitors from all parts of India to showcase their talents to an audience in the tens of thousands in a variety of forms ranging from music and dance to literature, theatre and fine arts. The amalgamation of talent, of songs and dance, artists and performers makes Varanasi come alive on February nights.</p>
 
			<p>Kashiyatra will boast of many firsts, an international MUN, treasure hunts across Varanasi, and exciting new events.</p>
